Coffee can be poured, just as with a regular coffee can, though here it is implemented vibrotactile and auditory feedback to further exploit the perception capacity available for user. Thus, the theme for this project is multimodal interaction, which is how systems can be designed to utilize input and output through different channels of perception, available for the user. By heightening the level of tactile and auditory feedback, the goal was to see if it is possible for visually impaired people to make fewer errors when pouring, as well as shortening the pouring time. Also, how will the user make sense of the feedback when exposed to it, will the assessment of the emitted feedback be significant enough to be higher regarded than their own practiced techniques, or will it be complementary."
