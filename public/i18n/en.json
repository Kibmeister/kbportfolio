Thus, the theme for this project is multimodal interaction, which is how systems can be designed to utilize input and output through different channels of perception, available for the user. By heightening the level of tactile and auditory feedback, the goal was to see if it is possible for visually impaired people to make fewer errors when pouring, as well as shortening the pouring time. Also, how will the user make sense of the feedback when exposed to it, will the assessment of the emitted feedback be significant enough to be higher regarded than their own practiced techniques, or will it be complementary."

In that time, I have seen him develop into a talented and dedicated User Interface (UI) Designer. I wholeheartedly recommend Kasper for any future opportunities in the UI/UX design field. From the very beginning, Kasper demonstrated a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the nuances of effective user interface design. He was able to quickly learn and apply the principles of our design system, leading to a seamless integration into our team. His willingness to learn and grow, along with his receptiveness to feedback, made it an absolute joy to work with him. A significant contribution by Kasper during his time at 4human was his development of the foundation for our design system documentation. This has greatly improved the efficiency and consistency of our design projects, ultimately leading to a more cohesive user experience across our product suite. In addition to his technical skills, Kasper possesses excellent communication and collaboration abilities. He was always eager to share his insights and ideas with the team, which fostered a positive and creative work environment. His passion for UI/UX design is evident, so I am confident that he will continue to excel in his career. Kasper is a valuable addition to any UX design team. He has not only proven his capabilities as a junior UI/UX designer but has also laid the groundwork for a successful and impactful career in the field. I have no doubt that Kasper will continue to impress and inspire those who have the privilege of working with him.",
