        "p1": "The Norwegian bird tracking service, Ringmerking.no, had become very old and needed a relaunch. How can we breathe new life into a very old bird registration service to attract new users, increase user adoption, and ultimately achieve higher registration rates for new birds?",
        "title2": "My Role",
        "p2": "As a UX designer in a team of two designers and four developers, I worked on conducting user research, analyzing and evaluating user insights, ideating over low-fidelity sketch prototypes and transferring them to Figma, testing prototypes with users, designing the identity of the service, developing clickable high-fidelity prototypes in Figma - as well as communicating all of this to the rest of the team."

      "page3": {
        "title": "The Goal",
        "titleP": "Carry out a comprehensive redesign of the service to make it mobile-first, user-friendly, usable, and attractive. The service should make it easier to register a bird observation, engage users, and at the same time respect existing users who are accustomed to current practices and use.",
        "p1Title": "Increase User Adoption",
        "p1": "The client wanted to increase the number of users to 10,000 on a national basis, which would be a 30% increase. Increased user adoption would have a positive impact on data collection and the protection of the Norwegian bird population.",
        "p2Title": "Mobile-first",
        "p2": "The existing solution was only available on PC, which means that a very large number of mobile users are left out. A mobile solution would have enabled bird  registrations on the go.",
        "p3Title": "Attract Younger Users",
        "p3": "As part of the desire for increased user adoption, the client wanted the service to be more appealing to young users. Using the service in school was a desirable outcome?"

        "p1": "The expert user had not many wishes for the page, and believed it was mostly functional and efficient for its tasks.",
        "p2Title": "We need more ring markers",
        "p2": "Nevertheless, there was a call among expert users that they wanted more users and, not least, registrations to the service. They believed that the initiative and responsibility about ring marking and bird management were important and should be more available to many.",

        "p2": "Mobile-first was also established as the basis for designing for a mobile platform and not desktop or tablet.

        "p1": "The registration sequence to register a find was convenient, but there were elements under this sequence that could be designed to make the registration less confusing.",

        "p1Title": "Insight Work",

This responsibility included working with mood boards, exploring color profiles that could suit the service, and working with brand association.",
        "p3Title": "Figma Prototype",
        "p3": "Together with my co-designer, my responsibility was to work on developing the Figma prototype through multiple iterations as more features were proposed and tested.

        "p2": "The design of a user experience or a user interface is one thing, another thing is the technical implementations that are necessary to develop a usable product that the customer can use. The technical often constitutes a limitation here. Therefore, it's extra important to have good cooperation and communication between designers and developers.",

        "p3": "User testing of a prototype is costly in terms of time and energy. However, a prototype that cannot be used is a waste of time. User testing should be done often, in step with working in frequent iterations. If one does not have time to call in users for user testing, one can always test on other colleagues or friends."

Thus, the theme for this project is multimodal interaction, which is how systems can be designed to utilize input and output through different channels of perception, available for the user. By heightening the level of tactile and auditory feedback, the goal was to see if it is possible for visually impaired people to make fewer errors when pouring, as well as shortening the pouring time. Also, how will the user make sense of the feedback when exposed to it, will the assessment of the emitted feedback be significant enough to be higher regarded than their own practiced techniques, or will it be complementary."

In that time, I have seen him develop into a talented and dedicated User Interface (UI) Designer. I wholeheartedly recommend Kasper for any future opportunities in the UI/UX design field. From the very beginning, Kasper demonstrated a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the nuances of effective user interface design. He was able to quickly learn and apply the principles of our design system, leading to a seamless integration into our team. His willingness to learn and grow, along with his receptiveness to feedback, made it an absolute joy to work with him. A significant contribution by Kasper during his time at 4human was his development of the foundation for our design system documentation. This has greatly improved the efficiency and consistency of our design projects, ultimately leading to a more cohesive user experience across our product suite. In addition to his technical skills, Kasper possesses excellent communication and collaboration abilities. He was always eager to share his insights and ideas with the team, which fostered a positive and creative work environment. His passion for UI/UX design is evident, so I am confident that he will continue to excel in his career. Kasper is a valuable addition to any UX design team. He has not only proven his capabilities as a junior UI/UX designer but has also laid the groundwork for a successful and impactful career in the field. I have no doubt that Kasper will continue to impress and inspire those who have the privilege of working with him.",
